  <img src="headshot.jpg" alt="Emmanouil Dimou Headshot" title ="Emmanouil Dimou Headshot" align=right width="250"/>
 <figcaption> I am a student-athlete majoring in Business Administration with a minor in Management Information Systems, combining my interest in business strategy with technology-driven solutions. Originally from Greece, I moved abroad to pursue higher education and competitive athletics, an experience that has shaped my resilience, independence, and global perspective. Adapting to a new academic system and culture has strengthened my problem-solving skills and ability to thrive in challenging environments.

Alongside my academic journey, I am an active basketball player, competing at the collegiate level. Basketball has played a major role in my personal development, teaching me discipline, leadership, teamwork, and time management. Balancing demanding training schedules, travel, and competition with a rigorous academic workload has required strong organization and focus, qualities that translate directly into my studies and professional goals. On the court, I value communication, accountability, and continuous improvement—principles I also apply in the classroom.

Academically, I maintain a strong GPA and have a growing interest in how information systems, databases, and web technologies support modern businesses. I am particularly drawn to the intersection of technology, user experience, and data-driven decision-making. My background in MIS has motivated me to understand not only how systems function, but how they can be designed effectively for real users.

I view web-based technology and design as essential tools in today’s digital world, and I am eager to continue developing skills that allow me to create efficient, accessible, and meaningful digital experiences both on and off the court.

  <h2 align=middle id="Basketball"> Basketball</h2> 
  <p align=middle>In December 1891, Dr. James Naismith invented basketball at a YMCA in Springfield, Massachusetts, to provide an indoor winter activity. Using a soccer ball and two peach baskets, he created 13 rules, allowing the game to spread quickly and evolve into a global sport. 
    Basketball has transcended its origins as a mere sport to become a profound cultural and social force, significantly influencing society worldwide. As a unifying force, it bridges diverse communities, breaking down cultural and socioeconomic barriers, particularly in urban areas where it serves as a positive outlet for youth. The sport has profoundly shaped fashion, particularly through sneaker culture—highlighted by Air Jordans—and streetwear, merging athletic apparel with everyday style.
Furthermore, basketball acts as a vehicle for social change and activism, with players like LeBron James utilizing their platforms to address critical issues like racial equality and education. It also has a massive economic impact, driving global entertainment and creating jobs through leagues like the NBA. Ultimately, the game represents resilience and teamwork, inspiring generations to pursue excellence both on the court and in their daily lives.

  <h2 align=middle id="Greek_Food"> Greek Food</h2> 
  <p align=middle> Greek cuisine is a vibrant Mediterranean tradition built on fresh, wholesome ingredients, primarily olive oil, lemon juice, wine, and aromatic herbs like oregano. It is a celebration of seasonal vegetables, cheeses—especially feta—and fresh seafood, alongside meats like lamb and pork. Dishes range from iconic street food like gyros and souvlaki to comforting, slow-cooked moussaka and savory filo pastries. Eating in Greece is a social event, often featuring meze-style shared plates that emphasize flavor, history, and warm hospitality.
