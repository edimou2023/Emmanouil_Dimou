  <h2 id="Basketball"> Basketball</h2> 
  <p>In December 1891, Dr. James Naismith invented basketball at a YMCA in Springfield, Massachusetts, to provide an indoor winter activity. Using a soccer ball and two peach baskets, he created 13 rules, allowing the game to spread quickly and evolve into a global sport.

  <h2 id="Greek_Food"> Greek Food</h2> 
  <p> Greek cuisine is a vibrant Mediterranean tradition built on fresh, wholesome ingredients, primarily olive oil, lemon juice, wine, and aromatic herbs like oregano. It is a celebration of seasonal vegetables, cheeses—especially feta—and fresh seafood, alongside meats like lamb and pork. Dishes range from iconic street food like gyros and souvlaki to comforting, slow-cooked moussaka and savory filo pastries. Eating in Greece is a social event, often featuring meze-style shared plates that emphasize flavor, history, and warm hospitality.
